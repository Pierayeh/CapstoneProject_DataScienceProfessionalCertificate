Looking at top 10 most common venues in these neighborhoods, I concluded that Japanese, Chinese, Korean restaurants are the most common restaurants in these neighborhoods. Also, the most common common places in the second biggest cluster in Vancouver, cluster number 5, are Parks, lakes, and trials which attracts many visitors specially during weekends. \n",
